# Team Version Control 
In order to manage version control in this project I used Git and GitHub. I also used GitFlow processes in order to manager version control over in a team environment. 

## Git Flow 
Gitflow is a branching model for git for use in teams. It envolves using a develop and a master branch as the building blocks of your project. Developers then create feature branches from the develop branch and merge back once the feature is completed and tested. The develop branch is then eventually merged back to the master branch for releases.
