# Test Coverage
The metric I used to analyse the projects test coverage was **EclEmma**. This is a free code coverage metric tool made specifically for Java and easily implemented through the Eclipse platform. 

## How To Use
The test coverage metric is built into Eclipse so there are no implementation steps. 

Simply, click on the run button in the eclipse menu and a report will be generated.

Clicking the first butto analyses your project and generates a report based on the test coverage present. You will get percentages of coverage of the whole project and then a break down of each classes coverage.
