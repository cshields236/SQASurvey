# Test Driven Development 
This project was implemented using Test Driven Developmet. Test Driven Development(TDD) is a software development process wherein the developer works backwards in a sense. The process involves making test before implementing a feature and then writing code in order to pass the test. Upon passing the test you then refactor the code.

The Key Principle of Test Driven Development is, Red, Green, Refactor.

- **Red**: Create failing test
- **Green**: Write code to satsify the test
- **Refactor**: Refactor code in order to make it more effecient, while still passing the test

## Example 
Here I will show an example of how I implmented TDD in the creation of features throughout this project, in this case the get maximum answer feature with links to the commits.

- [**Step One**](https://github.com/cshields236/SQASurvey/commit/78ac2a4c04cd0c86369aad26bacff4300ed3850d) Created failing test in the test class.

- [**Step Two**](https://github.com/cshields236/SQASurvey/commit/f94152b4f9a9b0cae3a09b8b84a5fe000bf0dab1) Here I implemented the get maximum answer feature in order to get the test to pass as expected.

- [**Step Three**](https://github.com/cshields236/SQASurvey/commit/28e367f3b86a45cd1ef8ed531ffb4c3e86ac6629) Here I refactored the working code and added comments to describe what is going on.
