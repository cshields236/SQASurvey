# Test Driven Development 
This project was implemented using Test Driven Developmet. Test Driven Development(TDD) is a software development process wherein the developer works backwards in a sense. The process involves making test before implementing a feature and then writing code in order to pass the test. Upon passing the test you then refactor the code.

The Key Principle of Test Driven Development is, Red, Green, Refactor.

- **Red**: Create failing test
- **Green**: Write code to satsify the test
- **Refactor**: Refactor code in order to make it more effecient, while still passing the test
