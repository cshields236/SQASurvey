# Sprint Planning 
This will show the best practice of how to organise a Sprint Backlog, assign estimates to each task and will explain the reasoning behind these estimates.

## Sprint Backlog 
The Sprint Backlog is a list of all features that need to be implemented by the dev team. Each Sprint is made up of a series of Sprint Backlog items. 

### Task Estimation
For this project I will be using the Planning Poker technique to Task Estimation and sizing. In this technique each task is assigned a story point value relating to the its complexity. When assigning these numbers I will be using the numbers the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). Using the Fibonacci sequence allows for a simple and clear distinction between task estimates. 

-  1 is the lowest number meaning it is a task which requires minimalal effort or problem solving i.e. a name change.
- 2 is slightly more complex but stil a straight-forward task i.e. adding a return statement.
- 3 is a task that would require a degree of computational thinking, but still relatively straightfoward, i.e. looping through a collection.
- 5 is a task which requires more logical thinking to implement, i.e. designing and implementing mathematical algorithims 
- 8 is the second highest value and should be given to a very complex function, i.e. carrying out a high degree of computation or data manipulation
- 13 is the highest value that can be given to a task on this scale. This would be a task which requires a very substantial amout of effort and solving to implemnt. If it is decided that a task is valued at 13 the team should work to try abd break the task down in to smaller steps.

**It is important not to size any task until it is broken down into its smallest possible increment.**

# Backlog 
## Tasks 
- Create new survey - **2**
- Add question to survey - **3** 
- Get a list of all surveys - **3** 
- Get surveys by name - **5**
- Create survey response - **2**
- Add new survey response - **2**
- Get all survey responses - **5**
    
**Survey Calculations**
 -  Average - **5**
 -  Standard deviation - **8**
 -  Minimum - **3** 
 -  Maximum - **3** 

 **Question Calculations** 
-  Average - **5**
 -  Standard deviation - **8**
 -  Minimum - **3**  
 -  Maximum - **3** 

 ### Reasoning 
 I will be comparing two tasks in order to show how I came to these conclusion on story points. The two tasks I will compare are: 
 - Create a new survey - which is sized a 2
- Get the survey average - which is sized a 5


When comparing the two its important to look at a few factors, the level of computational thinking, the complexity and the steps it will take to complete.
In the case of the task to create a survey there is very little complexity or problems to be solved, its just basic object creation.
Whereas when this is compared to getting the average, you must get all of the values from the collection they are stored in, get the sum of these values and get the number of values in the collection and divide the two numbers. 

As you can see there is a much higher level of complexity in the second task, which is why it has been sized higher
