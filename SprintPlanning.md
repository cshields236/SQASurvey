# Sprint Planning 
This will show the best practice of how to organise a Sprint Backlog, assign estimates to each task and will explain the reasoning behind these estimates.

## Sprint Backlog 
The Sprint Backlog is a list of all features that need to be implemented by the dev team. Each Sprint is made up of a series of Sprint Backlog items. 

### Task Estimation
For this project I will be using the Planning Poker technique to Task Estimation and sizing. In this technique each task is assigned a story point value relating to the its complexity. When assigning these numbers I will be using the numbers the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). Using the Fibonacci sequence allows for a simple and clear distinction between task estimates. 

-  1 is the lowest number meaning it is a task which requires minimalal effort or problem solving i.e. a name change.
- 2 is slightly more complex but stil a straight-forward task i.e. adding a return statement.
- 3 is a task that would require a degree of computational thinking, but still relatively straightfoward, i.e. looping through a collection.
- 5 is a task which requires more logical thinking to implement, i.e. designing and implementing mathematical algorithims 
- 8 is the second highest value and should be given to a very complex function, i.e. carrying out a high degree of computation or data manipulation
- 13 is the highest value that can be given to a task on this scale. This would be a task which requires a very substantial amout of effort and solving to implemnt. If it is decided that a task is valued at 13 the team should work to try abd break the task down in to smaller steps.

**It is important not to size any task until it is broken down into its smallest possible increment.**
